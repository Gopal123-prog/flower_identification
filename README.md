 README file for Image Classification

Overview:
This project is focused on image classification, which is the process of categorizing images into different classes or categories based on their visual content. The aim of this project is to build an image classifier that can accurately identify and classify images into various categories using machine learning algorithms.

Dataset:
The first step in any image classification project is to gather a dataset. In this project, we will be using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 3000 32x32 color images in 5 classes, with 600 images per class. The classes are: daisy,dandelion,rose,sunflower,tulip

Preprocessing:
Before training the model, we need to preprocess the data to make it suitable for training. We will be performing the following preprocessing steps:
1. Convert the images to grayscale or RGB format depending on the model we choose to use.
2. Resize the images to a uniform size so that they can be fed into the model.
3. Normalize the pixel values so that they lie between 0 and 1.
4. Split the data into training and validation sets.

Model Training:
We will be using the following machine learning algorithms for training the image classifier:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks. We will be using a deep CNN with several layers to achieve high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new model. We will be using the VGG-16 pre-trained model for transfer learning on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Model Evaluation:
After training the model, we need to evaluate its performance on the validation set. We will be using the following evaluation metrics:
1. Accuracy: The percentage of images that were correctly classified.
2. Confusion matrix: A table that summarizes the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
3. Precision and recall: Precision is the percentage of true positives among all positive predictions, while recall is the percentage of true positives among all actual positives.
4. F1 score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Conclusion:
In this project, we built an image classifier using machine learning algorithms like CNNs and transfer learning,performed preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and splitting the data into training and validation sets. Finally, we can use this model to classify new images into various categories with high accuracy about 89%.
